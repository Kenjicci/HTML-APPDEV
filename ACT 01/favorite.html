  <h3>Setting: </h3>
  <p>The setting of The Apothecary Diaries (Kusuriya no Hitorigoto) is an imperial palace in a world inspired by ancient China, particularly during a period resembling the Ming or Qing dynasties. 
    The palace is an elaborate and hierarchical environment where the emperor, his concubines, eunuchs, and servants live in strict confinement, isolated from the outside world. 
    The story primarily takes place in the women’s quarters of the palace, where the emperor’s consorts and maids reside.
    This setting is rich with cultural and historical influences, including the use of traditional medicine, court etiquette, and the complex political dynamics of palace life. 
    The closed nature of the palace, where every action and event is closely monitored, creates an atmosphere of secrecy, intrigue, and danger, 
    making it the perfect backdrop for the medical mysteries Maomao uncovers.

  <h4>Personal thoughts: </h4>
  <p>As the story progresses and more mysteries unfold, I found myself curious about the different facets of life in China during that period. 
    The way the how the characters portrayed themselves showed the different customs and traditions of that time period is fascinating. 
    When the first mystery of the debuted, Maomao showcased her critical thinking and her leaning towards science despite the prevalence of curses during that time.
    Then, she discovered it was because of the white powder present in the cosmetic products during that time. Researching about it, turned out it was <italic>asbestos</italic>,
    a substance responsible for lung cancer and other respiratory diseases! -Kenjicci
